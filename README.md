## Overview
Welcome to GroupTrack, an open-source Android application designed to enhance family safety through real-time location sharing and communication features. GroupTrack aims to provide peace of mind by ensuring the safety of your loved ones and facilitating seamless communication regardless of their location.

GroupTrack adopts the MVVM architecture pattern and leverages Jetpack Compose for building modern UIs declaratively. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development by allowing developers to define UI elements and their behavior in a more intuitive way, resulting in a seamless user experience.
