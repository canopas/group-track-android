# Grouptrack - Stay connected, Anywhere!
Enhancing family safety and communication with real-time location sharing and modern UIs.

<img src="./screenshots/cover_image.png"  alt="cover"  width="100%"/>

## Overview
Welcome to Grouptrack, an open-source Android application designed to enhance family safety through real-time location sharing and communication features. Grouptrack aims to provide peace of mind by ensuring the safety of your loved ones and facilitating seamless communication regardless of their location.

Grouptrack adopts the MVVM architecture pattern and leverages Jetpack Compose for building modern UIs declaratively. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and testable. Jetpack Compose simplifies UI development by allowing developers to define UI elements and their behavior in a more intuitive way, resulting in a seamless user experience.

## Security Features

### End-to-End Encryption
Grouptrack ensures the privacy and security of your data by implementing end-to-end encryption. This encryption method ensures that only the group members can access the location data, preventing unauthorized access by third parties.

- üîê **Signal Protocol Integration**
    - Leverages the industry-leading Signal Protocol for end-to-end encryption
    - Provides advanced cryptographic protection for all shared location data

- üîí **Comprehensive Data Protection**
    - All location data are encrypted before transmission
    - Encryption keys are uniquely generated for each user and space
    - No third-party, including Grouptrack servers, can access unencrypted data

- üîë **Advanced Encryption Mechanisms**
    - Utilizes industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256)
    - Implements secure key exchange protocols
    - Ensures data integrity and confidentiality

- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy Guarantees**
    - Encryption happens client-side before data leaves the device
    - Encrypted data is stored securely with no server-side decryption

*Note: End-to-end encryption ensures that only intended group member can decrypt and view shared information.*

### Google Maps SDK
To enable the MapView functionality, obtaining an API key as instructed in the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key) is required. This key should then be included in the local.properties file as follows:

```
MAPS_API_KEY=your_map_api_key
```

### Firebase Setup
To enable Firebase services, you will need to create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Use the `applicationId` value specified in the `app/build.gradle` file of the app as the Android package name.
Once the project is created, you will need to add the `google-services.json` file to the app module.
For more information, refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

Grouptrack uses the following Firebase services, Make sure you enable them in your Firebase project:
- Authentication (Phone, Google)
- Firestore (To store user data)
